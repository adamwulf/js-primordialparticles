# Javascript Primordial Particle Systems

## What is this?

This is an unofficial JS clone of the [PPS System](http://zool33.uni-graz.at/artlife/PPS) for cool demonstration purposes. It runs perfectly on an iPhone 6 but might not run smoothly on other browser/OS combinations yet... It is based on a simplistic JS multi agent simulation.

## How to run

For development open `index.html` on your local machine. The gh-page branch, can be seen here: https://elggem.github.io/js-primordialparticles/

## TODOS

  - Determine population density with acceptable FPS and adjust accordingly, introduce scaling to remain performant on slow machines and not drop below threshold for density.
  - Parameter tuning to achieve better behaviour.
  - ...?
